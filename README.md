# 3D-Game
This is project I made on my own in grade 11 using Java to apply OOP to a large project.

This is a small game that uses linear transformations on polygons to simulate a first person perpective. It allows the user to walk around and jump on blocks.

The program can read from obj files so that the models can be placed into the world. 

Lighting and depth function as intended with some slight bugs but there is no color. There was also some depth issues.
